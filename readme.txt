Authorizer limits login attempts, restricts access to specific users, and authenticates against external sources (OAuth2, Google, LDAP, or CAS).

== Description ==

*Authorizer* restricts access to a WordPress site to specific users, typically students enrolled in a university course. It maintains a list of approved users that you can edit to determine who has access. It also replaces the default WordPress login/authorization system with one relying on an external server, such as Google, CAS, LDAP, or an OAuth2 provider. Finally, *Authorizer* lets you limit invalid login attempts to prevent bots from compromising your users' accounts.

View or contribute to the plugin source on GitHub: [https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer)

*Authorizer* requires the following:

* **CAS server** (2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x) or **LDAP server** (plugin needs the URL)
* PHP extensions: php-ldap, php-curl, php-dom

*Authorizer* provides the following options:

* **Authentication**: WordPress accounts; Google accounts; CAS accounts; LDAP accounts; OAuth2 accounts
* **Login Access**: All authenticated users (all local and all external can log in); Only specific users (all local and approved external users can log in)
* **View Access**: Everyone (open access); Only logged in users
* **Limit Login Attempts**: Progressively increase the amount of time required between invalid login attempts.
* **Shortcode**: Use the `[authorizer_login_form]` shortcode to embed a wp_login_form() outside of wp-login.php.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `authorizer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Specify your server details in the 'Settings' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help! I've disabled WordPress logins, my external logins (Google/CAS/LDAP/OAuth2) aren't working, and now I can't get back in! =

If you add external=wordpress to the wp-login.php URL querystring, you can always get the WordPress login form to reappear. For example, if your site is at [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com), then the URL would be: [https://www.example.com/wp-login.php?external=wordpress](https://www.example.com/wp-login.php?external=wordpress)

= Where is this plugin used? =

The [University of Hawai'i][uh], which provides authentication for student, faculty, and staff members via a centralized service (CAS or LDAP).

[uh]: http://hawaii.edu/

== Changelog ==

= 3.11.0 =
* Fix for loading translations too early in WordPress 6.7.
* Add $user param to `authorizer_automatically_approve_login` hook; can be used to inspect the roles of the logging in user if they already have a WordPress user account.
* Disable Cloudflare Turnstile verification after a successful authentication provided by the simple-cloudflare-turnstile plugin. We assume we don’t need bot protection from this plugin after coming back from a successful external service authentication.
* Allow defining approved user welcome email subject and body via filters (`authorizer_email_approved_users_subject` and `authorizer_email_approved_user_body`) or wp-config.php constants (`define( 'AUTHORIZER_EMAIL_APPROVED_USERS_SUBJECT', '...' );` and `define( 'AUTHORIZER_EMAIL_APPROVED_USER_BODY', '...' );`) to, e.g., allow a single custom message to be used on all sites in a multisite network. Props @monkeyleo13 for the [suggestion](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/global-welcome-message-subject-body/)!
* Allow defining custom branding option via filter (`authorizer_advanced_branding`) or constant (`define( 'AUTHORIZER_ADVANCED_BRANDING', '...' );`). Props oldfieldtc for the [request](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/issues/169)!
* Allow specifying multiple roles to add and remove in the `authorizer_custom_role` filter by returning an array with keys `'default_role'`, `'roles_to_add'`, and `'roles_to_remove'`. Props nick-perry14 for the [pull request](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/pull/161)! (Note: you can also define additional roles in the `authorizer_custom_roles_to_add` and `authorizer_roles_to_remove` filters.)
* Allow specifying a list of "bypass users" who can log in with their WordPress credentials even if Disable WordPress Logins has been checked. Useful if most accounts are authenticated with an external service, but certain accounts, like temporary vendors or new hires, are not able to authenticate with an external service. Props lc-sam for the [request](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/issues/170)!

Client Secrets were already added in version 3.6.1, this update adds filters and constants for the Client IDs. Props @nks04747 for the [suggestion](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/storing-oauth2-client-id-in-wp-config/)!

* Add filter `authorizer_oauth2_generic_authorization_parameters` for targeting the specifics of generic oauth2 providers. Provide an array with options, such as `array( 'scope' => 'user:email' )`, to customize your generic oauth2 provider.
* Add filter `authorizer_oauth2_generic_authenticated_email` for manually inspecting the results returned from the oauth2 provider to find the resource owner's email to give to WordPress for the authenticated user. Use this for oauth2 providers that release email addresses in nonstandard places.
* Fix first/last names not getting updated for admins on a CAS or LDAP login.
* Fix PHP warning if invalid login attempt settings are empty (also prevent the “Authorizer lockout triggered for 0 seconds on user after the 0th invalid attempt” simple history log message).
* Fix update usermeta button disappearing in Approved Users list after clicking it.
* Fix serialization of usermeta in Approved Users list for unregistered users.
* Remove bootstrap dependency (replace glyphicons with WordPress dashicons).
* Update translatable strings.
* Update phpCAS from 1.3.6 to 1.3.8.
* Update Google API PHP Client from 2.7.1 to 2.8.1.
